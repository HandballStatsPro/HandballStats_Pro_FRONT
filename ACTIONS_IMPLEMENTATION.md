## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented the complete Actions (Acciones) functionality for your handball statistics application. Here's what has been implemented:

### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Action Service (`accionService.js`)**
   - Complete API integration with your backend
   - All CRUD operations for actions
   - Business logic validation functions
   - Enums and constants for all action types

2. **Actions List Page (`Acciones.jsx`)**
   - Display all actions in a table format
   - Filter actions by match
   - CRUD operations with proper permissions
   - Consistent styling with your application theme

3. **Action Form (`AccionForm.jsx`)**
   - Individual action creation and editing
   - Form validation based on backend rules
   - Handball court visualization for zone/detail selection
   - Real-time form validation with error messages

4. **Match Actions View (`MatchActionsView.jsx`)**
   - **Split-screen interface** as requested
   - Two team panels (Local/Visitante) with different colors
   - Real-time action recording during matches
   - Dynamic form controls that disable incompatible options
   - Possession tracking and automatic updates
   - Recent actions summary

5. **Handball Court Component (`HandballCourt.jsx`)**
   - Visual handball court representation
   - Interactive zone selection (Izquierda, Centro, Derecha)
   - Dynamic detail finalization points based on attack type
   - Different layouts for "Posicional" vs "Contraataque"
   - SVG-based court with proper styling

### Key Features:

#### Split-Screen Interface
- **Left Panel**: Local team with blue header (#669bbc)
- **Right Panel**: Visiting team with red header (#780000)
- Click on team to select and show action form
- Form fields appear dynamically based on selection

#### Business Logic Implementation
- **5 validation rules** from your backend implemented
- Real-time form validation with error feedback
- Automatic possession change calculation
- Dynamic field enabling/disabling based on selections

#### Handball Court Visualization
- Interactive SVG court representation
- Zone selection (Izquierda, Centro, Derecha)
- Different finalization details for attack types:
  - **Posicional**: Lanzamiento Exterior, Pivote, Penetración, Extremos, 7m
  - **Contraataque**: Contragol, 1ª Oleada, 2ª Oleada, 3ª Oleada

#### Navigation Integration
- Added "Acciones" to sidebar menu
- Added "Acciones" button to match list for quick access
- Proper routing for all action-related pages

### URLs Added:
- `/acciones` - Actions list
- `/acciones/new` - Create new action
- `/acciones/:id` - Edit action
- `/partidos/:id/acciones` - Match actions view (split-screen)

### Styling:
- Consistent with your application theme
- Colors: #780000 (red), #669bbc (blue), #28a745 (green)
- Bootstrap components with custom styling
- Responsive design

### Business Rules Implemented:
1. **7 meters special case**: When origin is 7m, detail must be 7m and type must be Posicional
2. **Attack type logic**: Different finalization details for Posicional vs Contraataque
3. **Event logic**: Required/optional fields based on event type
4. **Possession change**: Automatic calculation based on event and detail
5. **Sequential logic**: Origin action validation based on previous actions

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Access Actions**: Click "Acciones" in the sidebar or use the "Acciones" button in the match list
2. **Create Action**: Use "Nueva Acción" button or navigate to match-specific actions view
3. **Match Actions**: Click "Acciones" button next to any match to open the split-screen interface
4. **Record Actions**: 
   - Click on a team panel to select it
   - Fill in the action details
   - Use the handball court for zone/detail selection
   - Submit to record the action

## Technical Implementation:

The implementation follows your existing patterns:
- Uses React with Bootstrap for UI
- Axios for API calls
- Role-based permissions
- Error handling and validation
- Responsive design

All backend endpoints are properly integrated and the validation rules match your Java backend exactly.

## Next Steps:

The core functionality is complete. You can now:
1. Test the split-screen interface
2. Record actions during matches
3. View and manage all actions
4. Use the handball court visualization

Would you like me to add any additional features or make any modifications to the implementation?
